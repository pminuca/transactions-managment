# Transactions management

This project allows an user to display a list of transaction, filter the list by category or date, and delete, update and add a new transaction.

The user can also see the transaction summary by month and the global balance.

In order to reduce the scope, data is just stored in a file (instead of being stored in a database).

## Server
